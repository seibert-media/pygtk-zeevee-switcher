# pygtk-zeevee-switcher

Forked from [kunsi/pygtk-atem-switcher](https://github.com/Kunsi/pygtk-atem-switcher)
and modified to use our custom implementation of a mqtt-to-zeevee bridge
for easier input switching during events.

Please note this implementation does not support talking to a ZeeVee
server directly, however this could be modified to do so.
